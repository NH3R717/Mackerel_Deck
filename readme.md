## A PLC Program Written in Ladder Logic for the Allen-Bradley / Rockwell Automation Platform

### This software is intended to control the functionality of a fan coil unit (FCU) providing air condition to a occupied space used for food processing.

## Problem

### Refrigerant used to supply the FCU is a liquid @ approx. -35F is at a constant rate which creates coil blocking ice within less than 10 minutes. This condition restricts air flow and cooling ability.

## Solution

### Add functionality to the FCUs PLC program that allows the refrigerant supply solenoid valve to cycle open/close at set intervals (while the FCUs fans continue to run) only permitting refrigerant flow for sort durations â€“ preventing ice build-up.
