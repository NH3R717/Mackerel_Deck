# Mackerel Deck (Project Name)

## A PLC Program Written in Ladder Logic for the Allen-Bradley / Rockwell Automation Platform

### This software is intended to control the functionality of a fan coil unit (FCU) providing air condition to a occupied space used for food processing.

## Problem

### Refrigerant used to supply the FCU is a liquid @ approx. -35F is at a constant rate which creates coil blocking ice within less than 10 minutes. This condition restricts air flow and cooling ability. No form of active defrost is available/installed.

## Solution

### Add functionality to the FCUs PLC program that allows the refrigerant supply solenoid valve to cycle open/close at settable intervals (while the FCUs fans continue to run) only permitting refrigerant flow for sort durations – preventing ice build-up. Anticipated effective cycle time – approx. 3 minutes on 16 minutes off.
